  <ol>
    <li>Code for predicting identities in new datasets. The datasets could be gene expression patterns, multi-cell calcium imaging or whole-brain image stacks</li>
    <li>Code for building new atlas based on manually annotated datasets</li>
    <li>Raw datasets used in the paper as well as human annotations</li>
