<h1>CRF Cell ID</h1>
<p>
  This software was developed for automatically annotating biological identities of cells in dense brain images. 
  To learn about details of the method, please read the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.986356v1">paper</a>.
</p>
<p>
	A detailed guide on using the framework <b>coming soon</b>.
</p>
<p>
  This repository contains - 
  <ol>
    <li>Code for predicting identities in new datasets such as gene reporter expression, multi-cell calcium imaging or whole-brain imaging stacks</li>
    <li>Code for building new atlas based on manually annotated datasets</li>
    <li>Raw datasets used in the paper and ground-truth annotations</li>
